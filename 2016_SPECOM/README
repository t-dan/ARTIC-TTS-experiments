This repository contains data used for the experiments described in paper:

   Daniel Tihelka, Martin Grůber, Markéta Jůzová: Experiments with One--Class Classifier as a Predictor of Spectral Discontinuities in Unit Concatenation

The description of the data files:

DISTS.asf
- target distances for all the vowels computed for the whole corpus
- all of them are computer from the frames neighboring in the speech corpus, differing in length and overlap, though

DISTS-OK.asf
- target distances computed between frames taken from the left and right sides of the concatenated word halves
- thus, the frames were not neighbours in the corpus!
- distances in this set correspond to words evaluated by listeners as "without audible artefact"

DISTS-artefact.asf
- target distances computed between frames taken from the left and right sides of the concatenated word halves
- thus, the frames were not neighbours in the corpus!
- distances in this set correspond to words evaluated by listeners as "having audible artefact"


DISTS.*.train.json
- target distances used to train the OCC
- this is the 80% of 4000 distances randomly selected from DISTS.asf for the given phone
- this dataset is further randomly split to 80% used for training and 20% used for cross-validation, using ShuffleSplit class

DISTS.*.train.listn-artefact.json
- outlier distances used to test the OCC in the process of training
- they were obtained from DISTS-artefact.asf for the given phone (randomly selected half of all the data)

DISTS.*.eval.json
- target distances used to evaluate the trained OCC
- this the remaining 20% of 4000 distances randomly selected from DISTS.asf for the given phone

DISTS.*.eval.listn-OK.json
- target distances used to evaluate the trained OCC
- they were obtained from DISTS-OK.asf for the given phone

DISTS.*.eval.listn-artefact.json
- outlier distances used to evaluate the trained OCC
- they were obtained from DISTS-artefact.asf for the given phone (the remaining half of all the data)

ASF format description:

The ASF files (*.asf, from ARTIC segmentation file) are similar to CSV files, except the columns are space aligned (leading and trailing spaces can be
removed from data values), | is used as items separator, and header with column names is stored at line surrounded by [ ... ] brackets. Lines starting
with # are comments and can be ignored.

The content of the ASF file looking as:

    [ key_1 | key_2 | key_3 ]

    "section_key_1"
    | value | value | value |
    | value | value | value |

    "section_key_2"
    | value | value | value |

can be converted to python dictionary-of-arrays-of-dictionaries, looking as:
    {
        section_key_1 : [
            { key_1 : value,
              key_2 : value,
              key_3 : value
            },
            { key_1 : value,
              key_2 : value,
              key_3 : value
            }
        ],
        section_key_2 : [
            { key_1 : value,
              key_2 : value,
              key_3 : value
            }
        ]
    }

The training tools:

dummy_scaler.py:
std_scaler.py:
- simple scripts which creates data scaler instances; those are:
  * StandardScaler() used together with OCCSVM and ... classifiers
  * dummy scaler, not scaling the data at all, used together with ....

shuffle_split.py:
- simple script which creates ShuffleSplit() instance used to shuffle training/testing dataset parts during cross-validation
- the imput parameters is the number of samples used for training (i.e. the number of vectors in DISTS.*.train.json)

one_class_svm.py:
- simple script which creates OneClassSVM() instance and the set of parameters through which the grid search is carried out
